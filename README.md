### A Directory Scanner and Printer

### Splendir is WIP. There are no releases at this time. Approach with caution and assume features are missing or broken.

Creates tree views of files in a directory, annotated lists of files within a directory, and high-level reports of directory contents and file type distributions.

Splendir is built in Rust and implements a CLI tool, a GUI using Iced, and a reusable library.

### Install

This is a work in progress. No releases or binaries are provided at this time.

### Build

To build, ensure you are using Rust 1.88.0 or newer. Build the CLI and GUI binaries with:

```shell
cargo build --release
```
